# CodeRally - Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various competitive programming problems from the CodeRally competition.

## Problem Solutions

### 1. Biological Hazard

Solution: Java implementation using combination generation and set operations.
The solution generates all possible number combinations, then removes combinations that contain specific allergic-poisonous pairs.

### 2. From Dusk Till Down

Solution: Python implementation using Dijkstra's algorithm.
The problem requires finding the shortest path with time constraints (travel only during night hours 18:00-06:00).

### 3. War

Solution: Java implementation using Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank.
This solution handles relationships between entities (friends/enemies) efficiently.

### 4. Freckles

Multiple Solutions:

- Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's algorithm
- Prim's algorithm implementation variants

All solutions connect points in 2D space with minimum total distance.

## Utility Scripts

- brainNoWork.py: Backtracking algorithm for problem assignment
- towerofcubes.py: Dynamic programming solution for stacking cubes with face matching constraints
